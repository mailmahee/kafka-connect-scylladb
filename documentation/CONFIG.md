#ScyllaDB Sink Connector

Configuration Properties
------------------------

To use this connector, specify the name of the connector class in the ``connector.class`` configuration property.

    connector.class=io.connect.scylladb.ScyllaDbSinkConnector

Connector-specific configuration properties are described below.

###Connection

``scylladb.contact.points``

  The ScyllaDB hosts to connect to. Scylla nodes use this list of hosts to find each other and learn the topology of the ring. You must change this if you are running multiple nodes.
  It's essential to put at least 2 hosts in case of bigger cluster, since if first host is down, it will contact second one and get the state of the cluster from it.
  Eg. When using the docker image, connect to the host it uses.
  
  * Type: List
  * Importance: High
  * Default Value: [localhost]
  
``scylladb.port``
 
  The port the ScyllaDB hosts are listening on.
  Eg. When using a docker image, connect to the port it uses(use docker ps)

  * Type: boolean
  * Default: false
  * Importance: high
  
###SSL

``scylladb.ssl.truststore.path``
  Path to the Java Truststore.

  * Type: string
  * Default: ""
  * Importance: medium

  * Type: password
  * Default: [hidden]
  * Importance: medium

``scylladb.ssl.provider``
  The SSL Provider to use when connecting to ScyllaDB.

  * Type: string
  * Default: JDK
  * Valid Values: [JDK, OPENSSL, OPENSSL_REFCNT]
  * Importance: low

### Keyspace

``scylladb.keyspace``

  The keyspace to write to. This keyspace is like a database in the ScyllaDB cluster.
  * Type: String
  * Importance: High

``scylladb.keyspace.create.enabled``

  Flag to determine if the keyspace should be created if it does not exist.
  **Note**: Error if a new keyspace has to be created and the config is false.

  * Type: Boolean
  * Importance: High
  * Default Value: true

``scylladb.keyspace.replication.factor``
    
  The replication factor to use if a keyspace is created by the connector. 
  The Replication Factor (RF) is equivalent to the number of nodes where data (rows and partitions) 
  are replicated. Data is replicated to multiple (RF=N) nodes
  
  * Type: int
  * Default: 3
  * Valid Values: [1,...]
  * Importance: high

###Table

``scylladb.table.manage.enabled``

  Flag to determine if the connector should manage the table.

  * Type: Boolean
  * Importance: High
  * Default Value: true
  
``scylladb.table.create.compression.algorithm``
  
  Compression algorithm to use when the table is created.

  * Type: string
  * Default: NONE
  * Valid Values: [NONE, SNAPPY, LZ4, DEFLATE]
  * Importance: medium

``scylladb.offset.storage.table``

  The table within the ScyllaDB keyspace to store the offsets that have been read from Apache Kafka.
  This is used to enable exactly once delivery to ScyllaDB.

  * Type: String
  * Importance: Low
  * Default: kafka_connect_offsets

###Write

``scylladb.consistency.level``

  The requested consistency level to use when writing to ScyllaDB. The Consistency Level (CL) determines how many replicas in a cluster that must acknowledge read or write operations before it is considered successful.

  * Type: String
  * Importance: High
  * Default Value: LOCAL_QUORUM
  * Valid Values: ``ANY``, ``ONE``, ``TWO``, ``THREE``, ``QUORUM``, ``ALL``, ``LOCAL_QUORUM``, ``EACH_QUORUM``, ``SERIAL``, ``LOCAL_SERIAL``, ``LOCAL_ONE``

``scylladb.deletes.enabled``
  Flag to determine if the connector should process deletes. 
  The Kafka records with kafka record value as null will result in deletion of ScyllaDB record 
  with the primary key present in Kafka record key.

  * Type: boolean
  * Default: true
  * Importance: high

``scylladb.execute.timeout.ms``

  The timeout for executing a ScyllaDB statement.

  * Type: Long
  * Importance: Low
  * Default Value: 30000

``scylladb.ttl``

  The retention period for the data in ScyllaDB. After this interval elapses, ScyllaDB will remove these records. If this configuration is not provided, the Sink Connector will perform insert operations in ScyllaDB  without TTL setting.

  * Type: Int
  * Importance: Medium
  * Default Value: null

``scylladb.offset.storage.table.enable``

  If true, Kafka consumer offsets will be stored in ScyllaDB table. If false, connector will skip writing offset 
  information into ScyllaDB (this might imply duplicate writes into ScyllaDB when a task restarts).

  * Type: Boolean
  * Importance: Medium
  * Default Value: True

``scylladb.max.batch.size``
  Maximum size(in kilobytes) of a single batch consisting ScyllaDB operations. Should be equal to batch_size_warn_threshold_in_kb and 1/10th of the batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb configured in scylla.yaml. The default value is set to 5kb, any change in this configuration should be accompanied by change in scylla.yaml.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 5120
  * Valid Values: [0,...]
  * Importance: high

###Confluent Platform Configurations.

``tasks.max``

The maximum number of tasks to use for the connector that helps in parallelism.

* Type:int
* Importance: high

``topics``

The name of the topics to consume data from and write to ScyllaDB.

* Type: list
* Importance: high

``confluent.topic.bootstrap.servers``

 A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster used for licensing. All servers in the cluster will be discovered from the initial connection. This list should be in the form <code>host1:port1,host2:port2,â€¦</code>. Since these servers are just used for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership (which may change dynamically), this list need not contain the full set of servers (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down).

* Type: list
* Importance: high
